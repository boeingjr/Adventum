<h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>
Yeah, that's the problem.&nbsp; I didn't get to read the plans in time either before Riggle came back so now I can't proceed with the quest.&nbsp; I wish there was a way around this problem.&nbsp; Can't go back to talk to Pozzik or Zamek.&nbsp; The plans are gone.<br /><br />So now what?<br /><br />~Lia</div>

<div class="user-post-">
<h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>
The Bug people are hitting now is, if you have for some reason not finished reading the quest page, OR if your inventory is full (like mine was) you can't pick up the ore sample. <br />Then, you can't go back and do the quest over again. Which totally blows.<br />SO, MAKE SURE YOU GOT ROOM IN INV, AND BE IN THE GUY'S HUT WHEN THE BOMB GOES OFF.</div>

<div class="user-post-">
<h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>
I think the problem some ppl might be having is they r looking at the wrong guy.&nbsp; Rizzle is in the hut just north of the explosion.</div>

<div class="user-post-">
<h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>
Quest is NOT bugged as of this date.&nbsp; Talk to Pozzik, then Zamick (he's nearby).&nbsp; Zamick will hussle over and place a bomb.&nbsp; You can see Rizzle hussle out of his hut.&nbsp; Run in and click on the plans (they're lying on the floor in plain view).&nbsp; Accept Rizzle's Schematics quest (1650 xp).&nbsp; Then take the plans back to Pozzik (1650 xp).&nbsp; Easiest 3300 xp in the game.</div>

<div class="user-post-">
<h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>
I can't even get Pozzik to talk to me.&nbsp; Is this quest for Alliance only? Or does it have prereqs?<br />I'm a lvl 44 undead priest.</div>

<div class="user-post-">
<h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>
The level 58 player must have already done it and forgot about it or something - other than that, I have no explaination.<br /><br />I did this quest today.&nbsp; It was very simple. Scout the Gnome's side of the pit.&nbsp; You will find Rizzle standing atop of the schematics in question.&nbsp; He is inside a hut.<br /><br />Accept the quest from Pozzik, and then talk to Zamek. When Zamek heads off to plant his bomb DO NOT follow him - go straight to the schematic on the floor and wait.<br /><br />When the bomb explodes, Rizzle will go investigate.&nbsp; Right click on the plans, and complete the quest.</div>

<div class="user-post-">
<h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>
this worked for me... i talked to the guy who ran away, then over to the gnome house... the unguarded plans were right on the ground.... kinda odd to figure out, but i did it... <br /><br />&quot;life goes on long after the thrill of living is gone&quot;...</div>

<div class="user-post-">
<h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>
Have the guy go set the bomb and eventually Rizzle says what was that.&nbsp; Walk into the house nearby and the plans are on the ground.&nbsp; I had to do the distraction twice is all.</div>

<div class="user-post-">
<h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>
Folks this is the easiest quest you will ever do.<br />1650 x 2 exp.<br /><br />1. Get quest.<br />2. Talk to Zamek - he's a goblin right nearby, should have a BLUE ? mark over his head.&nbsp; Click ACCEPT. Then watch him run over and explode a bomb.&nbsp; At this point Rizzle will run out of his hut.&nbsp; Run in and loot the plans, looks like a scroll on the floor.&nbsp; Click Complete then Accept the next quest (Rizzle's Schematics)<br />3. Return to Pozzik for completion.<br /><br />Couldn't be easier.</div>

<div class="user-post-">
<h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>
Wonder if they did something cuz pozzik isn't around... I see Zamek but... <br /><br />Edit:&nbsp; ok he was hiding near the rocket race cars... have to do the vulture bones first I guess. (quest Load Lightening)<br /><br />Edit 2:&nbsp; Okay now next quest Goblin Sponsorship.&nbsp; Fedex to ratchet.<br /><br />Edit 3:&nbsp; well hmph!&nbsp; I'm lvl 43 and cannot get Pozzik to give me this quest.&nbsp; Am sure I didn't do it before with this toon.&nbsp; Sigh</div>

<div class="user-post-">
<h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>
Look in the little building where Brassbolts is inside... the plans are on the floor behind him. When he runs out to check on the noise, you just pick them up. Easy as pie!</div>

<div class="user-post-">
<h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>
All you have to do is talk to Zamek and then run over to Rizzle in the building (Zamek will run in just about the right direction of Rizzle).&nbsp; And just keep trying to (open) pick up the plans.&nbsp; It will say that it is unguarded.&nbsp; And that is all you have to do for it to work.&nbsp; <br /><br />Oh and if you don't get to the plans in time, just go back to Zamek to distract again (he will have a blue ? over his head) and do it again... this time making sure to get to Rizzle in time before he comes back. :)</div>

<div class="user-post-">
<h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>
speak with the goblin Zamek close to the house (had a blue question mark for me) and complete the quest to get him to make a distraction. follow him across the raceway to the gnome hut, he makes a distraction which makes the gnome boss run out of his house. run in, grab the plans, done.</div>

<div class="user-post-">
<h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>
completed just now.....simply enter house and take the scroll on the floor as soon as u talk to the &quot;dude who creates the distraction&quot;</div>

<div class="user-post-">
<h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>
You go talk to Zamek - he should have a blue ? above his head, he'll say lets go! and run across to the other house, go inside, and wait for the little gnome to run out, unlock the plans, make sure you have at least one space open in your inventory, complete quest, accept next one, go back across to the other guy and turn it in. Very Easy. Continuation is going back to Badlands to get more indurium.</div>

plans in blue building<br />wait for him to leave because of the bomb pick it up no problem.</div>

<div class="user-post-">
<h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>
Zamek is just to the right of the hut behind Pozzik. He'll cross over to other part of mirage raceway and you just go into hut on that side of the raceway and wait for Rizzle Brassbolts to leave and right click on plans under his feet and bring them back to Pozzik.&nbsp; Simple, quick and easy exp points (30 - 45 secos to complete).</div>

<div class="user-post-">

<div class="user-post-">
<h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>
I got Zamek to create the disturbance, was standing right next to Brassbolts when he left, read the plans, hit complete, and whammo!&nbsp; Quest complete!&nbsp; Too easy!</div>

<div class="user-post-">
<h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>

This quest is fixed.<br /><br />Please note the requirement for the quest is the last part of the Indurium quest line (News for Fizzle) as this is the plan that you must steal after help the Brassbolts brothers to obtain it in the first place from martek the Exiled in Badlands.</div>

If you don't accept the next quest, Rizzle's Schematics, the quest seems broken. However, you can just go into the hut and click on the schematics to start the quest again, even if the guy is standing in there.<br /><br />At least that's what happened to me. Once you've &quot;opened&quot; the schematics, they stay open and you can get the quest to lead to the ore quest.<br /><br />Cheers.</div>

<div class="user-post-">
<h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>
As Zamek creates the diversion, just run into the little hut (only small hut on the gnome side I believe) and as Rizzle runs out, open the schematic on the ground. Don't waste time reading it, I don't believe there's enough time, and he'll probably come back to interupt you if you do try.<br /><br />The chain leading to get Indurium Ore (sp?) from Uldaman is a blue quest, so you can't really accept it and have it in your quest log.

There is still a possible problem with this quest thread, and I have sent a message to the GMs. I successfully distracted Rizzle, but at first wasn't sure where to go. I finally found the little hut he was in, and saw the plans that initiate the quest dialogue for the next step.

<h2 class="heading-size-3">Description</h2>
The Brassbolts brothers have discovered a new building material, that's the only explanation that makes sense. Their cars have been operating faster than before, but their designs, and all the other data we've gathered from their runs is identical.<br /><br />What we do know, is that Rizzle Brassbolts has been focused on the plans for this new discovery almost constantly.<br /><br />Zamek can create a diversion for you, so that you can steal those plans from them.
