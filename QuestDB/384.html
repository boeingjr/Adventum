The snowy climes of Dun Morogh provide a perfect mountain home for the dwarves of Azeroth, not to mention an isolated place for their gnomish cousins to ply their gadgeteering trade. After the fall of Gnomeregan to an invasion of kneehigh furry hostiles known as troggs and a subsequent experiment in military tech gone very bad, both gnomes and dwarves call the city of Ironforge (in north central Dun Morogh) their capital. The trogg overflow extends well into western Dun Morogh, but though Gnomeregan is suited to adventurers in their high 20s-lower 30s, all mobs in Dun Morogh proper are a match for adventurers levels 1-10 (though we'll point out a handful that are &quot;elite&quot; - that is, suited to a small group of adventurers close to that particular mob's level). The compleate Walkthrough for this area can be found here</div>
