I'm fairly sure you have to venture back into BRD just to turn into this quest in order to proceed to &quot;A Shred of Hope&quot;.&nbsp; Whoever said you can turn it in at Morgan's Vigil is wrong.&nbsp; Basically for this chain you have to keep going back to Marshall Windsor in a 5 man group at least 4 times for one quest or another, and &quot;free&quot; him about twice.<br /><br />Its one of the most annoying and REDUNDANT chains in the game, but you have to do it if you want to get smacked down by Onyxia.</div>

I spent 2 hours clearing and reclearing and reclearing the entrance mobs (I'm a 60 rogue, had friends reset the instance for me). After about 3 deaths, and other various problems, still no note. I read on here that you can get them off the level 46 non-elite slaves outside of BRD, figured I'd give it a try. Got the note on my second kill. Kill the slaves for this, it's easy</div>

In the quarry from a 48 slave. Then dropped again from a warden who also drop the dark iron fanny packs for another quest and even an occasional green item.</div>

At the beginning of the run, the note was not dropping at all. Then, after we went through the bar door, the note started droppping like crazy.&nbsp; Must have dropped over 20 times between the bar and the emperor. It was nuts.</div>

After you talk to the Marshal in the dungeon, you HAVE to return to Marshal W. in burning steppes before the note will drop.<br /><br />At the advice of this thread, I farmed lvl 48-49 non-elite slaves in a 'safe' area outside of the instance (but down on the bottom inside the mountain outside the instance door).&nbsp; It dropped on about the 10th slave.<br /><br />Here's a great thread I found which details the rest of the quest line (as well as before, but I didn't have a hard time finding info on the quests before the crumpled note).<br /><br /><a href="http://nerfed.lx.ro/?p=1" rel="nofollow">http://nerfed.lx.ro/?p=1</a></div>

Like the thotbott stats shows the crumpled note best drops is from the non elite yellow non agressive slaves on entrance to BRD with an approximate drop rate of 1.5% whch is better by x15 than the 0.1% of most groups in BRD, i farmed them for 10-15 mins and got the crumpled note which has to be taken to marshal windsor and handed in especially before anyone starts the jailbreak quest,even though more knowlegable players apparently told me thott was wrong and i wouldnt get the drop, rubbish, farm the slaves for it no problems.</div>

<div class="user-post-">
<h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>
I followed the advice above and started with the first yellow slave to my left - got the note on my third kill.&nbsp; Thanks!</div>

Unreal!&nbsp; I killed one of the elite Dwarves outside the instance and got it on the FIRST KILL!&nbsp; Dunno if they made it easier or I wasted my maybe one-and-only WoW miracle drop on a crumpled up note........smeg!</div>

<h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>
The note dropped for me four times right next to Angerforge in BRD. Hes through the locked doors and all the way down the hall. 4 dropped notes in 20 kills. I'd say thats a good place to start. Then go back and do Windsor. Be aware that this is a long chain and you must be at a certain point in the chain (i.e. have escorted Windsor out of BRD once before) in order for the note to drop. That makes at least to runs on Windsor that you will have to do. Hope that helps:)</div>

<h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>
biggest confusion on this quest...marshal windsor is inside of a prison cell in BRD, marshal maxwell on the other hand is the NPC at morgan's vigil in burning steppes. keep that in mind.</div>

Just did this portion a second time, dropped first kill. Droprate is very high, says it is low because there are many people that have killed these mobs that don't have the correct part of the quest chain done, or have already finished it etc.<br /><br />So as long as you have done the quest up to this point, the note should drop very quickly.</div>

So you go into BRD to talk to Marshal Windsor after doing the True Master quest chain. You talk to him. Now can you get the crumpled note off a mob in BRD or do you have to go to Maxwell, and then the Crumpled Note will start dropping? <br /><br />It's hard enough to find groups for BRD to do the quests (everybody wants to grind the bosses for loot) without having to fight your way to Windsor and then have to leave to talk to someone else who doesn't even give you a new quest (if I didn't look here I would have thought I did something wrong)and then go back and fight my way to Windsor AGAIN (hopefully with the note dropping along the way).<br /><br />So, can you do the Talk to Maxwell part later or what?</div>
